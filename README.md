# WeatherApp

Hello!

I'm studying in frontend development and this is my first pet-project.
In this project I'm using HTML, CSS and JS only.

As it obvious from the title, it's a weather website.

- For searching I use [openweather API](https://openweathermap.org/).
- It's also possible to use your current location to know the weather.

While I was writing this code I've studied basic principles of coding (thanks to [ScheCodes](https://www.shecodes.io/) for this).

You can see this project by this [link](https://sweet-brioche-9f330f.netlify.app/).

Designer: [Filipp Basko](https://www.linkedin.com/in/filipp-basko-379175236/).
